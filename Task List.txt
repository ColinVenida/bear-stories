========

-design/create a scene for the reader to choose a story
***Project now has a home scene that allows users to choose the story.  Created a ScrollRect and a BookCover prefab that enlarges the cover
when the BookCover is pressed

Create/Design scenes that accomodate multiple pages
-have dropdown options saved between pages
-create an animation that simulates a page turning in the story
*NOTE* a simple design is have page turning buttons up in the front of the story, separated from the Page Game Objects.
	This can also apply to the Language and Voice Over Controls

	eg.
		Main Camera
		Canvas
			Book
				Page Array[]
					Pages
					Page Controls
			Language Controls
			Voice Over Controls

	-Create a Book Prefab, and a Page Prefab
		A Book object will have an array of Pages and UI controls for the Pages

***Created a Page, and Book prefabs with supporting scripts.  All universal GameObjets should be 
encapsulated inside these prefabs.  Will update prefabs as needed.
