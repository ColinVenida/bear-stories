when the BookCover is pressed

*NOTE* a simple design is have page turning buttons up in the front of the story, separated from the Page Game Objects.
	This can also apply to the Language and Voice Over Controls

				Page Array[]
					Pages
					Page Controls
			Language Controls
			Voice Over Controls

	-Create a Book Prefab, and a Page Prefab
		A Book object will have an array of Pages and UI controls for the Pages

encapsulated inside these prefabs.  Will update prefabs as needed.
